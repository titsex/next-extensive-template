# About
> #### Extensive template for NEXT.js with redux and redux-toolkit already set up.
> #### Bootstrap and bootstrap-icons are already included in the project.
> #### A separate bonus for beginners is that the project has examples of using redux and redux-toolkit in asynchronous mode.
> #### The project was created so that developers do not waste their time on pre-configuration, and it will be useful for beginners to see examples of a real project.
